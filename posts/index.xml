      <description>In the recent months it has become more and more clear for everyone to see that putting everything in one companies&amp;rsquo; hands doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work out for you afterall.
The probably most recent / most popular example is the shutdown of Google+. Of course, the ArchiveTeam tried to backup Google+, but Google seemed to try and block the effort, by throttling downloads.
While you probably, as most of us, didn&amp;rsquo;t actually use it, someone else might&amp;rsquo;ve and they might&amp;rsquo;ve used it actively.</description>

      <description>Continuing my true fashion of only blogging every now and then, here I am.
This is basically my nuclear take on (as the time of writing) this still developing shitshow.
Basically, what happened is this:
 In March 2016, Elon Musk unveiled Tesla&amp;rsquo;s new car, the Model 3; promising the car would eventually cost around $35,000 &amp;hellip;later doubling down on Twitter (as a true CEO does) that it would cost &amp;ldquo;around&amp;rdquo; $35,000 from the start &amp;hellip;and deliveries would start late 2017 As Tesla is known to do, they, of course, delayed deliveries for four more months.</description>

      <description>Okay, today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about an easy topic that probably has been discussed a million times in the last few weeks by people way smarter than I am.
Yet, some of you might actually care about someone else&amp;rsquo;s perspective.
Recently, Alex Jones has been all over every kind of media outlet, because his fish oil shop conspiracy website InfoWars was banned from two kinda important websites: YouTube and Facebook.</description>

      <title>Mastodon in Docker and AWS</title>

      <description>By now, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard about Mastodon, which is all the rage right now.
It is, functionality wise, a (almost) perfect replacement for ~~the birdsite~ Twitter. Lately, Twitter has become a cesspool infested with people that I do not want in my filter bubble community.
Since Mastodon is federated one can run their own instance. Running stuff is hard though, especially in production and becomes exponentially harder if more people start using it.</description>
