      <description>Okay, today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about an easy topic that probably has been discussed a million times in the last few weeks by people way smarter than I am.

      <description>By now, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard about Mastodon, which is all the rage right now.
It is, functionality wise, a (almost) perfect replacement for ~~the birdsite~ Twitter. Lately, Twitter has become a cesspool infested with people that I do not want in my filter bubble community.
Since Mastodon is federated one can run their own instance. Running stuff is hard though, especially in production and becomes exponentially harder if more people start using it.</description>
