      <p>Continuing my true fashion of only blogging every now and then, here I am.</p>

<p>This is basically my <a href="https://twitter.com/nucleartakes">nuclear take</a> on (as the time of writing) <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190228/p36#a190228p36">this still developing shitshow</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, what happened is this:</p>

</ol>

<p>Okay, back to present.
As I write this, it&rsquo;s the 1st of March, 2019.
Late yesterday, Tesla finally announced the availability of the once promised $35,000 Model 3, only a mere <em>7 months</em> after deliveries started (<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/35000-Tesla-model-3-available-now?redirect=no">Here&rsquo;s the official announcement</a>)</p>

<p>Rejoice, right?
Well, not so fast.</p>

<p>What they announced was not only the much anticipated cheaper version <del>something something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen">people&rsquo;s car</a></del>, they also announced</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Model 3 Standard Range Plus, 240 miles of range, top speed of 140 mph, 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider me impressed, anything else?
</br>Of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uhm, wait a minute, what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn’t needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note what they say, specifically:
</br><strong>You can&rsquo;t test-drive a Tesla anymore.</strong></p>

<p>You can easily just buy one, see?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn’t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Of course Elon, I&rsquo;ll just get a &gt;=$35,000 loan, drive the car for a week and give it back if I don&rsquo;t like it</em>
</br><em>Fuck</em>, no.</p>

<p>They will also remove most stores and convert some to showrooms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <em>do</em> consider this very impressive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But keep in mind what Marco Arment, Tumblr co-founder, founder of Instapaper and Overcast <em>and owner of a Model S</em> has to say:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Same-hour service isn’t going to help when the parts they need are backordered for months. <a href="https://t.co/33qGVamoRA">https://t.co/33qGVamoRA</a></p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1101279792530407424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All in all, I consider this the wrong decision.
What Tesla desperately need was <em>more</em> scale, <em>more</em> delivered cars, <em>more</em> service infrastructure and as many test drives as possible to get <em>as many</em> interested customers as possible.
</br>I know literally no one who would ever buy a car without being able to test-drive one.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla_Bear">Someone</a> <em>way</em> smarter than me started a <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla_Bear/status/1100520637540564994">fantastic thread</a>, collection various aspects and owners opions about this, after analyzing the whole situation.</p>

<p>Please, for the love of whatever you consider holy, read the <em>entire</em> thread and come back here.</p>

<p>Okay, now think about what you just heard.</p>

<p>Does this sound like a company you&rsquo;d be willing to give a hefty amount of money for a car you&rsquo;ve never driven before?</p>

<p>What Tesla is able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate a massive amount of hype for a very expensive product</li>
<li>build an amazing electric drive train and power supply for that drivetrain</li>
<li>build passenger cars that <a href="https://youtu.be/gOuOulH02bs?t=201">go <em>crazy fast</em> down the quarter mile</a> (10.79 seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>What Tesla, seemingly, is not able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-ntsb-tesla-fatal-crash-report-model-s-battery-reignited-twice-after-florida-crash/">build a battery that doesn&rsquo;t catch fire after crashing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla-model-3-rear-bumper-rain/">build a car that doesn&rsquo;t loose body parts after driving through water</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/9vmmR3P58gs">that get&rsquo;s wet inside when it rains</a></li>
<li>build a car <a href="https://twitter.com/asfalcone/status/1090626168171253760"><em>with</em></a> <a href="https://youtu.be/5PU0Kbo5Tos"><em>functioning</em></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6giiao/my_model_x_90d_driver_side_falcon_door_opened_on/"><em>doors</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Look, I admire what they do.</p>

<p>I even <em>test-drove</em> a P85+, back when it was the fastest Model S, during their <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autoextrem.de%2Fartikel-news%2F1063-tesla-model-s-probefahrten-9-orten-deutschland-fully-charged-tour.html">fully charged</a> tour through Germany.</p>

<p>I <em>loved</em> it.
</br>I enjoyed driving this massive, fairly luxurious, heavy car, that despite all that, would accelerate like a proper sports car, it even almost drove like one all around!</p>

<p>But all I see nowadays is how bad Tesla is at scaling and how good Elon is at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results-reaction/tesla-must-stop-overpromising-could-need-more-finance-analysts-idUSKBN1D21A3">over-promising and under-delivering</a>.</p>

<p>I would have been a happy camper if Tesla came out of nowhere and just left a burning mess of the slow, boring shitshow that (most of) the automotive industry really is.
</br>But it seems Tesla just wants to build cars for people who <em>don&rsquo;t enjoy</em> cars.</p>
