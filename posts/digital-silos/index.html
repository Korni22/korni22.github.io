    <div class="post-content">
      <p>In the recent months it has become more and more clear for everyone to see that putting everything in one companies&rsquo; hands doesn&rsquo;t really work out for <em>you</em> afterall.</p>

<p>The probably most recent / most popular example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B#Shutdown_of_consumer_version">the shutdown of Google+</a>.
</br>Of course, the <a href="https://www.archiveteam.org">ArchiveTeam</a> <a href="https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Google%2B">tried to backup Google+</a>, but Google <em>seemed</em> to try and block the effort, <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1112494767601053696">by throttling downloads</a>.</p>

<p>While you probably, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B#Growth">as most of us</a>, didn&rsquo;t actually use it, someone else might&rsquo;ve and they might&rsquo;ve used it actively.
</br>Now imagine this is what you use to communicate with most of your extended family, upload vacation photos for them to enjoy and comment your cousin&rsquo;s wedding announcement.</p>

<p>But what if Google suddenly decides that Google+ is no longer worth running and announces it&rsquo;s shutdown?
This is exactly what Google did, with less than 4 months of time to do &hellip; well what exactly?</p>

<p>There is basic export-functionality, but where would you move, anyway?
Facebook is, privacy-wise at as bad as Google is, and, well, social network wise, that&rsquo;s about it.
The problem is, we have no realistic alternative to Facebook.</p>

<p><em>Yes</em>, there <em>are</em> a few <a href="https://github.com/gdamdam/awesome-decentralized-web#microblogging-and-social-network">decentralized alternatives</a> around, but none of them have any real world usage (maybe <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>, but that might just be my filter bubble and it&rsquo;s still different from being Google+ or Facebook).
<a href="https://diasporafoundation.org">Diaspora</a> tried to achieve that years ago, but for whatever reason it never really caught on.</p>

<p><em>For the user there is no real alternative besides</em> <strong>move to Facebook</strong> <em>which, if you ask me, <strong>sucks ass</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Facebook should&rsquo;ve never gotten that big, we should&rsquo;ve moved to something based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> years ago, since it&rsquo;s easy to host, easy to migrate, interoperable with other ActivityPub-based stuff and it&rsquo;s getting easier to use by the minute.</p>

<p>The only thing keeping me on Twitter and YouTube are the <em>people and their content</em>, not the (mostly) shitty platforms.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care if YouTube satisfies the advertisers or the investors, what I care about is the new video from my favorite creator, which <em>just happens to be</em> on YouTube, but might as well be on <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>, <a href="https://about.d.tube">DTube</a> or whatever (Sidenote for PeerTube: it&rsquo;s based on ActivityPub as well, which means your subscriptions and creator-updates will show up just fine in your Mastodon-timeline! ðŸŽ‰).</p>

<p>The same rules, of course, apply for <em>checks notes</em> backups as well.
A few years ago I used a service called Everpix, which I used to backup my photos. I loved it, it was fast, easy, cheap, it ticked all the boxes. But then, of course, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup">it had to shut down</a>
</br>I hastily replaced it with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/17/5624890/dropbox-acquires-loom">Loom</a>, which was, you guessed it, shutdown after Dropbox <del>killed it</del> shut it down <em>with 4 weeks notice</em>.</p>

<p>After that, I once again scrambled to find a replacement &hellip; which was <a href="http://blog.picturelife.com/post/109541575280/picturelife-joins-streamnation">PictureLife</a>.
</br>Of course, it <del>got killed</del> shut down as well.</p>

<p>Luckily, it&rsquo;s shutdown happened after I had migrated all my stuff to Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud#iCloud_Photo_Library">iCloud Photo Library</a>, but now all my stuff is at Apple&rsquo;s mercy. If they ever shutdown (lol) or get acquired (lol), I will be in the situation I got out of just in time.</p>

<p>Now once again we rely heavily on services the tech giants provide us with.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t <em>own</em> our movies, we watch them on our Netflix/Prime Video/Hulu/Disney+ subscription (or which ever asshole comes up with another one by the time I have finished this post).</p>

<p><em>But I can still buy a digital copy of any move, dipshit!</em>
</br>Well, of course you can, but you should pray to <del><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/mar/07/tim-apple-donald-trump-gets-name-of-tech-giants-ceo-wrong-video">Tim Apple</a></del> Tim Cook that Apple can <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5001191">keep the rights forever</a>, otherwise you&rsquo;ve bought <em>jack shit</em>. Yes, you get a refund, but it won&rsquo;t be in cash but iTunes credit instead, so don&rsquo;t even think about buying that movie on Prime Video.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re always at the mercy of the original rights holder, waiting to take away things you <em>bought</em>.
</br>Geez, I can&rsquo;t possibly imagine why people still pirate movies.</p>

<p>If companies won&rsquo;t let us <em>legally</em> own stuff in a digital way (I&rsquo;m not talking about an optical disc), people will pirate what they want, the only one who get&rsquo;s fucked is the lawful customer and the owner, never the pirate.</p>

<p>But I digress, back to topic.</p>

<p>We need to get out of <em>digital silos</em>.
</br>We need to stop using one single company and every service they offer.</p>

<p>Stop using Safari&rsquo;s reading list, use <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> or <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>.
</br>Stop using Amazon&rsquo;s Kindle service, use <a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide/ebooks">literally any other service</a>, preferrably one without DRM.
</br>If you can, stop using Dropbox, iCloud Drive and whatever, run a <a href="https://nextcloud.com">NextCloud</a> instance.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stop centralizing, start decentralizing.</em></strong></p>
